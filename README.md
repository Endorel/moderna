 ## Warning!
 There is a possible security issue with this project. One of the packages used in this project is missing Origin Validation, meaning hackers can gain access to the source code.

I had some problems with getting the images for the items in the array. In the end I decided to use one of them as placeholder, but there is code to handle the images dynamically.
